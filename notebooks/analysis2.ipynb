    "The Metacritic video game dataset can be used as a tool to analyze different trends that arise by comparing different columns, because of the different kinds of information each provides. A video game has a developer, and a developer may have multiple video games. Similarly, a video game has a genre, and a genre may apply to many different video games. Video game genres wax and wane in popularity. Also, video game developers do not necessarily restrict themselves to one particular genre. I wanted to explore the relationship between developer and genre: is there a specific genre that a developer tends to develop games of? If so, has this trend changed over the years for any particular developer, or has it remained largely the same?"
