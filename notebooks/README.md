# Notebooks Folder

This will be the directories containing all of our member's .ipyb files (notebook files), which are the notebooks containing our codes that we did or will be using for development/analysis throughout the project

- `analysis1.ipynb` : Kate Naychuk's
- `analysis2.ipynb` : Fareeha Hayat's
- `analysis3.ipynb` : Orvin Tritama's

- `/ungraded/` : Anything you don't want to be marked or looked at can be placed in this folder.   
- You may add additional subdirectories within the current structure, but try to avoid creating any directories in the project root. If you have questions about this, you can ask the project TA.
