    "For this data analysis project, I have chosen to find the relationship between the genre of video game and the number of players each game allows. Is there a specific genre that leans towards multiplayer or single player? Does this relationship affect the diversity amongst popular titles? These are just some of the questions I hope to exlore. Answering these may be useful in predicting what to expect from upcoming video games or to provide the relevant information needed to create a unique product. My goal is to find out if there are any patterns, analyze them, and understand why they may occur."
