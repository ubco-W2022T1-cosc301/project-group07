## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

As a group, we have found a common interest in video games which makes this dataset perfect for us because of this personal connection. Due to the wide range of categories that the attributes provide, we are able to propose many possible areas of research. This works well alongside our initial goal which was to find a dataset that allowed us more flexibility than not. We discussed the most and least interesting topics as a group and decided who would focus where. Some of the questions we are aiming to answer are “What is the shift in the trend of platforms used in the video gaming industry from 1995 to 2020” and “Do certain game developers tend to focus on a specific genre?”. We believe that this data is able to be represented clearly through a dashboard and has the ability to be shown effectively though many different charts and graphs. As a result, we hope to efficiently filter through the relevant data to answer our questions and neatly display our findings for quick analysis.
