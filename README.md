## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

As a group, we have found a common interest in video games which makes this dataset perfect for us because of this personal connection. Due to the wide range of categories that the attributes provide, we are able to propose many possible areas of research. This works well alongside our initial goal which was to find a dataset that allowed us more flexibility than not. We discussed the most and least interesting topics as a group and decided who would focus where. Some of the questions we are aiming to answer are “What is the shift in the trend of platforms used in the video gaming industry from 1995 to 2020” and “Do certain game developers tend to focus on a specific genre?”. We believe that this data is able to be represented clearly through a dashboard and has the ability to be shown effectively though many different charts and graphs. As a result, we hope to efficiently filter through the relevant data to answer our questions and neatly display our findings for quick analysis.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data in our dataset was collected from Metacritic. Metacritic is a website that collects reviews for different kinds of media. There is specifically a large number of video game reviews on it. BrunoVR (on Kaggle) has compiled the data, and stored it in a csv file, with over 10000 video game titles. It includes information about each game such as the platform, release date, developer, genre, and number of players. There is also information on the scores from both critics and users, as well as the number of critics or users that reviewed each game. We may disregard some of this information to clean up the dataset and make it easier to work with. The data was collected on November 10, 2020. The video games in the data were released between April 29, 1995 and November 10, 2020. The data was originally collected using a scraper, to create a simple content-based recommender system. BrunoVR has also created a dashboard for data exploration and the recommender system. The data was collected for both learning purposes (exploratory data analysis) and for fun.
