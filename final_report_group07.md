# Final Report

### Introduction

This project examines a Metacritic Video Game dataset in order to discover interesting trends in the gaming industry. These trends can involve a variety of different attributes of a game and how they relate to other attributes, such as the platform and the genre of a game. Our group has a common interest in video games, and we were excited to see what we could find out using exploratory data anaylsis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis


### Question 1 + Results


### Question 2 + Results

The second research question inquired if there is a specific genre that a developer tends to develop video games of, and to analyze, for this developer, whether or not the most developed genre had changed over the years. The results of the data analysis in [analysis2.ipynb](./notebooks/analysis2.ipynb) gave us an insight of the most popular genres for the chosen developer, Nintendo.

Given the distribution plot of Nintendo's genres, it was apparent that their most popular genres were Miscellaneous, Action, and Platformer. Discarding the 2D, Miscellaneous, and General genres due to non-specificity, we analyzed the trend of Nintendo's top 5 genres: Action, Platformer, Action Adventure, Fantasy, and Simulation.

We noticed that while certain genres certainly had more attention than others as a whole, often the most developed genre in a year could differ from the most developed genre in another year. Nintendo's most popular genre overall, Action, was not always the most developed genre from 1995 to 2020. There were years where the action genre was actually less popular than the other genres, such as Simulation games peaking in 2005. We also noticed that a genre could peak in popularity more than once, at different points in time. Not only did the Action genre peak in 2009, but also in 2019, among other years.

This answers our research question, whether there is a specific genre that a developer tends to develop games of, and whether the most developed genre had changed over the years or not. Nintendo tends to develop Action games (after Miscellaneous), and it's genre trend is not stable: the Action genre is not always the most popular in a given year, and different genres will wax and wane in popularity.

### Question 3 + Results
