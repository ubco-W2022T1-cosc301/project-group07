# Data

This is the root directory of our data, containing both the raw and processed data directories, which will be the root source of our analysis

- `data/raw` - raw data should go in this directory; you should add the original source file here. Always keep the original data file without editing.
- `data/processed` - You can add cleaned up, and processed data files in this directory.
